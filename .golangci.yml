    gocyclo:
      # Cyclomatic complexity threshold: 50 (current baseline)
      #
      # Highest function: ControllerPublishVolume (48)
      # CSI RPC handlers have legitimate complexity from:
      #   - Go's explicit error handling (no exceptions)
      #   - CSI spec compliance (extensive validation requirements)
      #   - State machine logic (attachment states, device paths)
      #
      # Top offenders (for future refactoring):
      #   1. ControllerPublishVolume: 48
      #   2. RecordEvent: 44
      #   3. NodeStageVolume: 36
      #   4. NewDriver: 33
      #   5. main: 31
      #
      # Ratchet-down plan: Refactor highest functions when touched next.
      # Target: 30 after ControllerPublishVolume refactored, 20 by v1.0
      min-complexity: 50

    cyclop:
      # Function and package cyclomatic complexity threshold: 50
      #
      # Matches gocyclo threshold for consistency. Many functions
      # (ControllerPublishVolume 48, RecordEvent 44, NodeStageVolume 36,
      # NewDriver 33, main 31) are CSI/infrastructure code where complexity
      # comes from spec requirements (volume capability validation, device
      # path resolution, attachment state handling) rather than business logic.
      #
      # Target: Ratchet to 30 after refactoring ControllerPublishVolume
