# RDS CSI Driver - Capabilities & Comparison

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the RDS CSI Driver's capabilities, comparing it with mature CSI drivers like AWS EBS CSI and Longhorn to help operators make informed deployment decisions.

## Overview

**Driver Version:** v0.9.0 (v0.10.0 in progress)
**Maturity:** Production-tested on homelab cluster with KubeVirt workloads
**Target Use Case:** Single-server NVMe/TCP storage for Kubernetes on MikroTik ROSE Data Server
**Architecture:** Single-node storage backend (not distributed storage)

The RDS CSI Driver is designed for a specific deployment scenario: high-performance block storage for Kubernetes clusters using MikroTik's ROSE Data Server as a centralized storage appliance. It is not intended to compete with distributed storage solutions like Longhorn or Ceph. Instead, it provides a simpler, lower-latency alternative for environments where a single high-performance storage server is appropriate.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **NVMe/TCP Protocol:** Lower latency (~1ms) vs iSCSI-based drivers (~3ms)
- **File-backed Volumes:** Flexible sizing on Btrfs RAID without LVM overhead
- **SSH Management:** Secure, auditable, debuggable control plane
- **Production Focus:** Battle-tested resilience features from actual production incidents

## CSI Specification Coverage

The driver implements CSI Specification v1.5.0+ with the following capabilities:

### Identity Service

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| CONTROLLER_SERVICE | ✅ Supported | Driver provides controller component |
| VOLUME_ACCESSIBILITY_CONSTRAINTS | ✅ Supported | Topology-aware scheduling for node affinity |

**Implementation Details:**
- GetPluginInfo returns driver name (`rds.csi.srvlab.io`) and version
- GetPluginCapabilities declares controller service support
- Probe validates RDS connectivity (SSH health check)

### Controller Service

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| CREATE_DELETE_VOLUME | ✅ Supported | SSH-based provisioning with Btrfs file backing |
| PUBLISH_UNPUBLISH_VOLUME | ✅ Supported | VolumeAttachment tracking with stale attachment reconciliation |
| LIST_VOLUMES | ✅ Supported | Enumerates volumes via `/disk print` RouterOS command |
| LIST_VOLUMES_PUBLISHED_NODES | ✅ Supported | Tracks node attachments via Kubernetes VolumeAttachment API |
| GET_CAPACITY | ✅ Supported | Returns Btrfs storage pool capacity via SSH |
| EXPAND_VOLUME | ✅ Supported | Online expansion (controller resizes file, node detects automatically) |
| CREATE_DELETE_SNAPSHOT | 🔄 Planned (v0.10.0) | Phase 26 - Btrfs snapshot support via RouterOS CLI |
| LIST_SNAPSHOTS | 🔄 Planned (v0.10.0) | Phase 26 - Snapshot enumeration |
| CLONE_VOLUME | ❌ Not Planned | RouterOS doesn't expose Btrfs reflink via CLI (architectural constraint) |
| GET_VOLUME | ❌ Not Implemented | Optional capability, not required by CSI spec |
| VOLUME_CONTENT_SOURCE | 🔄 Planned (v0.10.0) | Required for snapshot restore (Phase 26) |

**Why Not Clone Volume:**
Volume cloning would require Btrfs reflink support, which RouterOS doesn't expose through the CLI interface. While the underlying Btrfs filesystem supports reflinks, there's no `/disk clone` command. Implementing this would require RouterOS-level changes outside the CSI driver's control.

**Why Not GET_VOLUME:**
This is an optional CSI capability primarily used for validation. The driver can enumerate volumes via LIST_VOLUMES, making GET_VOLUME redundant for our use case.

### Node Service

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| STAGE_UNSTAGE_VOLUME | ✅ Supported | NVMe/TCP connect, filesystem format, mount to staging path |
| EXPAND_VOLUME | ✅ Supported | Kernel automatically detects block device resize (no explicit resize2fs/xfs_growfs) |
| GET_VOLUME_STATS | ✅ Supported | Real filesystem statistics via statfs(2) |
| VOLUME_CONDITION | ✅ Supported | NVMe device health checks via nvme-cli |
| SINGLE_NODE_MULTI_WRITER | ❌ Not Supported | NVMe/TCP namespaces are single-initiator (protocol limitation) |

**Why Not SINGLE_NODE_MULTI_WRITER:**
NVMe/TCP namespaces in RouterOS are exported as single-initiator targets. Allowing multiple nodes to connect simultaneously would require shared filesystem support (like GFS2 or OCFS2) and RouterOS multi-host NVMe namespace configuration, which isn't supported by the platform.

## Unique Advantages

The RDS CSI Driver offers several unique advantages for its target use case:

### 1. NVMe/TCP Protocol Performance

**Advantage:** Native NVMe/TCP protocol provides ~1ms latency vs ~3ms for iSCSI-based drivers.

**Why It Matters:** For latency-sensitive workloads like databases and KubeVirt VMs, every millisecond counts. NVMe/TCP's kernel-space implementation eliminates userspace overhead.

**Trade-off:** Requires NVMe/TCP kernel module (standard in Linux 5.0+) and dedicated storage network for optimal performance.

### 2. File-backed Volume Flexibility

**Advantage:** Btrfs file-backed volumes provide thin provisioning, flexible sizing, and transparent resizing without LVM complexity.

**Why It Matters:** Adding a 50GB volume doesn't immediately consume 50GB of physical storage. Btrfs sparse files grow as data is written. Online expansion is trivial (just resize the file).

**Trade-off:** RouterOS manages Btrfs directly; no direct operator access to filesystem tools.

### 3. SSH-based Management

**Advantage:** All control plane operations are SSH-based, providing auditable, debuggable, human-readable commands.

**Why It Matters:** When troubleshooting, you can SSH to RDS and manually run the same commands the driver uses. Full audit trail via RouterOS logs. No "black box" API.

**Trade-off:** SSH latency adds ~200ms to volume provisioning. Not suitable for high-frequency create/delete operations.

### 4. Attachment Reconciliation

**Advantage:** Automatic recovery from stale VolumeAttachment state after infrastructure failures.

**Why It Matters:** Born from production incident (Phase 25.1). When RDS crashes or nodes fail, driver automatically cleans up stale attachments, preventing "volume stuck in use" scenarios that require manual intervention in other drivers.

**Trade-off:** Adds complexity to controller logic. Requires VolumeAttachment API access (RBAC).

### 5. NVMe-oF Reconnection Resilience

**Advantage:** Comprehensive handling of NVMe-oF controller renumbering via `ctrl_loss_tmo=300` and automatic reconnection.

**Why It Matters:** Survived production RDS crashes without losing volume connectivity. Kubernetes workloads remain running through brief storage interruptions.

**Trade-off:** 300-second timeout means volumes may appear "stuck" during RDS restarts. Fine for infrastructure maintenance, not suitable for sub-second failover requirements.

### 6. Production-tested KubeVirt Integration

**Advantage:** Live migration validated in production with ~15-second migration window. Block volume mode fully supported.

**Why It Matters:** Many CSI drivers claim KubeVirt support but haven't been tested with live migration. RDS CSI has been validated in production with VMs that have been migrated across nodes without downtime.

**Trade-off:** KubeVirt-specific features like hotplug not yet tested/documented.

## Architectural Differences

Understanding the architectural differences between RDS CSI and other drivers is essential for setting correct expectations:

### Single-Server vs Distributed Storage

**RDS CSI:** Single MikroTik RDS server provides storage for entire cluster.

**Longhorn:** Distributed storage with replica placement across multiple nodes.

**Why It Matters:** RDS CSI's reliability model depends on RDS hardware (RAID, power, network). Longhorn's reliability comes from software replication. Different failure domains.

**When to choose RDS CSI:**
- Homelab/small clusters where a single high-quality storage server is acceptable
- Latency-sensitive workloads where NVMe/TCP beats distributed storage overhead
- Environments where infrastructure is managed outside Kubernetes (RouterOS)

**When to choose Longhorn:**
- Multi-node deployments requiring storage HA
- Environments where every node has local storage
- Need for automated recovery from storage node failures

### NVMe/TCP vs iSCSI vs Cloud API

**RDS CSI:** NVMe/TCP protocol for data plane, SSH CLI for control plane.

**AWS EBS CSI:** AWS API for both control and data plane (EBS volumes attach via AWS infrastructure).

**Longhorn:** iSCSI protocol for data plane, REST API for control plane.

**Why It Matters:**
- NVMe/TCP has lower CPU overhead than iSCSI (kernel-space vs userspace)
- SSH CLI is synchronous and slower than REST APIs
- Cloud APIs abstract hardware, SSH CLI exposes it

### Single Controller vs High Availability

**RDS CSI:** Single controller replica (no leader election).

**AWS EBS CSI:** AWS manages controller HA transparently.

**Longhorn:** Multiple controller replicas with leader election.

**Why It Matters:** RDS CSI's single controller is an intentional simplification. Since the storage backend is a single server, adding controller HA doesn't improve storage availability. During controller pod restarts (~10s), existing volumes remain accessible; only new provisioning/deletion is affected.

**Trade-off:** Brief provisioning unavailability during controller restarts. Acceptable for homelab/small cluster; not suitable for large-scale multi-tenant environments.

## What's Not Supported and Why

This section provides honest assessment of capabilities the driver doesn't support, with explanations of why.

### Volume Cloning

**Status:** ❌ Not Planned

**Why Not:** RouterOS doesn't expose Btrfs reflink functionality through its CLI interface. While the underlying Btrfs filesystem supports efficient copy-on-write cloning, there's no `/disk clone` command. Implementing this would require RouterOS-level API changes outside the CSI driver's control.

**Workaround:** Create snapshots (Phase 26) and restore to new volume. Not instant like reflink cloning, but achieves the same end result.

### ReadWriteMany (RWX) Access Mode

**Status:** ❌ Not Supported (protocol limitation)

**Why Not:** NVMe/TCP namespaces in RouterOS are single-initiator targets. The NVMe protocol allows multiple connections to a namespace, but the filesystem on top would need to be cluster-aware (GFS2, OCFS2, NFS). RDS doesn't support multi-host namespace export in the way that would enable RWX.

**Workaround:** Use separate volumes per pod (RWO) or deploy a shared filesystem layer on top (NFS server running on a single node with RDS-backed storage).

### Controller High Availability

**Status:** ❌ Not Planned (intentional simplification)

**Why Not:** The storage backend is a single MikroTik RDS server. Adding controller high availability (multiple replicas with leader election) doesn't improve storage availability. If RDS fails, storage is unavailable regardless of controller replica count.

**Trade-off:** During controller pod restarts (~10s), new volume provisioning/deletion is unavailable. Existing volumes remain accessible. This is acceptable for homelab and small cluster deployments.

**When This Matters:** Large multi-tenant clusters with high provisioning rates. For those use cases, distributed storage (Longhorn, Ceph) is a better fit.

### Volume Encryption

**Status:** ❌ Not Supported (RouterOS limitation)

**Why Not:** Volume encryption would need to be implemented at the RouterOS level (LUKS, dm-crypt) or within the Btrfs pool configuration. RouterOS doesn't currently expose encryption configuration through the CLI for NVMe/TCP exported volumes.

**Workaround:** Use network encryption (VPN/IPSec for NVMe/TCP traffic), encrypt at application layer, or encrypt the entire Btrfs pool on RDS (if RouterOS supports it - requires manual configuration outside CSI driver).

**When This Matters:** Compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS) that mandate encryption at rest. For those use cases, use a driver with native encryption support (AWS EBS CSI, encrypted Longhorn volumes).

### Multipath Support

**Status:** ❌ Not Applicable (single storage endpoint)

**Why Not:** Multipath is used to provide redundant paths to the same storage target. RDS CSI connects to a single RDS server with a single storage IP. There's no secondary path to configure.

**Architectural Note:** Dual-IP configuration (management vs storage network) is for traffic separation, not multipath failover. If the storage network fails, there's no alternate path to the NVMe/TCP target.

### Ephemeral Volumes

**Status:** ❌ Not Supported

**Why Not:** CSI ephemeral volumes (CSIInlineVolume) require support for per-pod volume provisioning without PVC. RDS CSI assumes PVC-based provisioning with volume lifecycle tied to PVC, not pod.

**Workaround:** Create PVC with `reclaimPolicy: Delete` for similar behavior. PVC deletion triggers volume deletion.

**Impact:** Pods can't use inline CSI volume specification. Must create PVC first.

## Roadmap & Future Features
