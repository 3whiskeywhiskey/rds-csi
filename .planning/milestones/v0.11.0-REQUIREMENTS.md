# Requirements: RDS CSI Driver

**Defined:** 2026-02-17
**Core Value:** Volumes remain accessible after NVMe-oF reconnections

## v0.11.0 Requirements

Requirements for v0.11.0 Data Protection milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Snapshot Implementation

- [x] **SNAP-01**: CreateSnapshot creates a CoW copy of a volume via `/disk add copy-from`
- [x] **SNAP-02**: DeleteSnapshot removes the copied disk entry and underlying file
- [x] **SNAP-03**: RestoreSnapshot creates a new volume from a snapshot via copy-from
- [x] **SNAP-04**: ListSnapshots returns snapshot metadata (source volume, creation time, size)
- [x] **SNAP-05**: Snapshot survives deletion of source volume (independent CoW copy)
- [x] **SNAP-06**: Snapshot disk is not NVMe-exported (immutable, no writes possible)

### Snapshot Testing

- [x] **TEST-01**: Snapshot create/restore/delete validated against real RDS hardware (TC-08 documented)
- [x] **TEST-02**: Mock RDS server updated to use copy-from semantics instead of Btrfs subvolume
- [x] **TEST-03**: CSI sanity tests pass for snapshot operations (70/70)

### Scheduled Snapshots

- [x] **SCHED-01**: CronJob manifest creates VolumeSnapshot on configurable schedule
- [x] **SCHED-02**: Retention cleanup deletes snapshots older than configurable age
- [x] **SCHED-03**: CronJob template included in Helm chart

### Resilience Regression

- [x] **RESIL-01**: NVMe reconnect after network interruption preserves mounted volumes
- [x] **RESIL-02**: RDS restart doesn't cause data loss on connected volumes
- [x] **RESIL-03**: Node failure cleanup removes stale VolumeAttachments

## Future Requirements (carried forward)

### Snapshot Enhancements

- **SNAP-F01**: Snapshot-based volume cloning (CreateVolume from volume, not just from snapshot)
- **SNAP-F02**: Cross-RDS snapshot replication for disaster recovery

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Btrfs subvolume snapshots | File-backed disks aren't subvolumes; copy-from is the correct approach |
| Application-consistent snapshots | Requires app-level quiesce hooks (Velero territory, not CSI driver) |
| Snapshot scheduling operator | CronJob is simpler and sufficient; operator adds unnecessary complexity |
| Read-only snapshot mounting | Snapshots are for backup/restore, not for mounting as read-only volumes |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| SNAP-01 | Phase 29 | Complete |
| SNAP-02 | Phase 29 | Complete |
| SNAP-03 | Phase 29 | Complete |
| SNAP-04 | Phase 29 | Complete |
| SNAP-05 | Phase 29 | Complete |
| SNAP-06 | Phase 29 | Complete |
| TEST-01 | Phase 30 | Complete |
| TEST-02 | Phase 30 | Complete |
| TEST-03 | Phase 30 | Complete |
| SCHED-01 | Phase 31 | Complete |
| SCHED-02 | Phase 31 | Complete |
| SCHED-03 | Phase 31 | Complete |
| RESIL-01 | Phase 32 | Complete |
| RESIL-02 | Phase 32 | Complete |
| RESIL-03 | Phase 32 | Complete |
