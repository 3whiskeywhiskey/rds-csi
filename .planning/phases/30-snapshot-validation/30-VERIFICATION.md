# Phase 30: Snapshot Validation Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Snapshot operations are verified correct by automated tests and real hardware, with no mock-reality divergence for the copy-from approach
**Verified:** 2026-02-18T04:47:33Z
**Status:** passed (with 1 human verification item for hardware execution)
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Mock RDS server handles /disk add with copy-from parameter to create snapshot disk entries | VERIFIED | `handleDiskAddCopyFrom()` at line 516 in `test/mock/rds_server.go`; 14 occurrences of "copy-from" in file |
| 2 | Mock RDS server does NOT handle /disk/btrfs/subvolume/* commands (removed) | VERIFIED | `grep -c "btrfs/subvolume" test/mock/rds_server.go` returns 0 |
| 3 | Snapshot disks created via copy-from have no NVMe export flags in mock state | VERIFIED | `formatSnapshotDetail()` at line 829 emits slot/type/file-path/file-size/source-volume/status — no nvme-tcp-export fields |
| 4 | Mock snapshot disk entries are independent copies (deleting source does not delete snapshot) | VERIFIED | `TestMockRDS_SnapshotCopyFrom/"snapshot independent of source"` subtest passes; snapshots stored in separate `s.snapshots` map |
| 5 | /disk print detail returns snapshot entries with slot, file-path, file-size, type=file, no nvme-tcp-export | VERIFIED | `handleDiskPrintDetail()` at line 739 routes to `formatSnapshotDetail()` for snapshot slots; formatSnapshotDetail returns correct fields |
| 6 | /disk remove works on snapshot slots for delete | VERIFIED | `handleDiskRemove()` at line 682 checks `s.snapshots` at line 722 and deletes from map |
| 7 | /file remove works on snapshot backing files for belt-and-suspenders cleanup | VERIFIED | `handleDiskRemove()` also removes backing file from `s.files`; confirmed by sanity test SSH command log showing `/file remove [find name="...snap-....img"]` |
| 8 | CSI sanity test suite passes all snapshot test cases (CreateSnapshot, DeleteSnapshot, ListSnapshots) with zero failures | VERIFIED | `go test ./test/sanity/ -v -timeout 120s` output: 70 Passed, 0 Failed |
| 9 | Snapshot create/delete/list operations work end-to-end through CSI gRPC -> driver -> mock SSH -> mock RDS | VERIFIED | Sanity test log shows full command chain: `/disk add type=file copy-from=[find slot=...] ... slot=snap-...` then `/disk print detail where slot=snap-...` then `/disk remove [find slot=snap-...]` then `/file remove [find name="...snap-....img"]` |
| 10 | Hardware validation TC-08 documents the copy-from snapshot approach and is ready for manual execution against real RDS | VERIFIED | TC-08 heading reads "Volume Snapshot Operations (copy-from)"; Execution section at line 1572-1574 present |
| 11 | TC-08 SSH verification commands use /disk print detail (not /disk/btrfs/subvolume/print) | VERIFIED | `grep -c "btrfs/subvolume" docs/HARDWARE_VALIDATION.md` returns 0; Step 4 and Step 7 use `/disk print detail where slot~"snap-"` |
| 12 | TC-08 expected RDS output shows type=file without nvme-tcp-export (not type=snapshot with read-only=yes) | VERIFIED | `grep -c "type=snapshot" docs/HARDWARE_VALIDATION.md` returns 0; `grep -c "read-only=yes" docs/HARDWARE_VALIDATION.md` returns 0; TC-08 notes explicitly state "NO nvme-tcp-export" |

**Score:** 12/12 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `test/mock/rds_server.go` | Updated mock RDS server with copy-from snapshot semantics | VERIFIED | 1007 lines; contains `handleDiskAddCopyFrom`, `formatSnapshotDetail`, `s.snapshots` map, `slot~` wildcard handling, `source-volume` field in snapshot output |
| `test/mock/rds_server_test.go` | Tests for copy-from snapshot handlers in mock server | VERIFIED | 763 lines; `TestMockRDS_SnapshotCopyFrom` at line 444 with 6 subtests: create, independence, query, delete, nonexistent-source-fail, restore-creates-nvme |
| `test/sanity/sanity_test.go` | CSI sanity test with working snapshot parameters | VERIFIED | 220 lines; `TestSnapshotParameters` at line 204; `mock.NewMockRDSServer` wired at line 78; 70/70 pass including snapshot tests |
| `docs/HARDWARE_VALIDATION.md` | Updated TC-08 with copy-from snapshot validation steps | VERIFIED | 1898 lines; TC-08 at line 1285; 6 occurrences of "copy-from"; Execution section at line 1572 |
| `pkg/utils/snapshotid.go` | Updated GenerateSnapshotID deriving ID from CSI name only (UUID v5) | VERIFIED | 198 lines; `GenerateSnapshotID` at line 49 uses UUID v5 of CSI name only — not source volume |
| `pkg/rds/commands.go` | Removed ExtractSourceVolumeIDFromSnapshotID fallback from parseSnapshotInfo | VERIFIED | `parseSnapshotInfo` reads `source-volume=` field directly; no fallback extraction |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `test/mock/rds_server.go` | `pkg/rds/commands.go` | SSH command format matching `/disk add.*copy-from` | WIRED | Sanity test log confirms driver sends `/disk add type=file copy-from=[find slot=...]` and mock handles it correctly |
| `test/mock/rds_server.go` | `test/sanity/sanity_test.go` | `mock.NewMockRDSServer` at line 78 | WIRED | Sanity test instantiates mock server; 70 tests execute through it |
| `test/sanity/sanity_test.go` | `pkg/driver/controller.go` | CSI gRPC calls CreateSnapshot/DeleteSnapshot/ListSnapshots | WIRED | Sanity test invokes CSI spec tests that exercise CreateSnapshot, DeleteSnapshot, ListSnapshots via in-process gRPC |
| `docs/HARDWARE_VALIDATION.md` | `pkg/rds/commands.go` | SSH commands documented match actual driver implementation | WIRED | TC-08 Step 4 shows `/disk print detail where slot~"snap-"` which matches `ListSnapshots` command in commands.go |

### Requirements Coverage

No REQUIREMENTS.md rows specifically mapped to phase 30 were found. Phase goal was derived from ROADMAP.md phase description directly.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| None found | — | — | — |

Scanned all 6 modified files for TODO/FIXME/placeholder/stub patterns. None detected. All functions are substantively implemented — no empty returns, no `return null` stubs, no console.log-only handlers.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. TC-08 Manual Hardware Execution Against Real RDS

**Test:** Execute TC-08 steps from `docs/HARDWARE_VALIDATION.md` against real RDS hardware at 10.42.241.3:
1. Create a PVC and a VolumeSnapshot via kubectl
2. SSH to RDS and run `/disk print detail where slot~"snap-"` — confirm snapshot disk entry appears with no NVMe export fields
3. Restore snapshot to new PVC; confirm restored volume is accessible from a pod
4. Delete the VolumeSnapshot; confirm both disk entry and .img backing file are removed from RDS

**Expected:** All 4 steps succeed; snapshot appears as `type="file"` with no `nvme-tcp-export` field on RDS; restored volume is writable; snapshot disk and .img file are both gone after delete

**Why human:** Real RDS hardware at 10.42.241.3 is required. Cannot be automated without access to the physical MikroTik RouterOS appliance and a running Kubernetes cluster with KubeVirt. TC-08 documentation explicitly marks this as a manual execution step.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All automated verification targets pass. The only outstanding item is the hardware execution of TC-08, which is intentionally deferred to manual execution as documented in the TC-08 "Execution" section.

**Test run results (verified live):**

- `go test ./test/mock/... -count=1`: PASS (4.9s)
- `go test ./pkg/... -count=1`: PASS (all 10 packages)
- `go test ./test/sanity/ -v -timeout 120s`: PASS — 70 Passed, 0 Failed, 21 Skipped
